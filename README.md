Identifying High Valueble Customers by modeling Life Time Value (LTV).

Team Members: Ernesto Beltran,Mike Whitmore,Francisco Lobeira,Aparna

Objective: 
Predict Customer Life-time Value (LTV)for a Auto Insurance Company.
The lifetime value of a customer, or customer lifetime value (LTV), represents the total amount of money a 
customer is expected to spend in business, or on products, during their lifetime. This is an important figure
to know because it helps company to make decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers 
and retaining existing ones. We will build different models ranging from liniar regressions to deep learning.
After assesing the reliebility and performnce of each model, we will create an inputs dashboardwhere the company's
 managment team will be able to input the independent varaibles and rank potential customers in order to 
allocate effective resources. We belive this model can dictate the marketing budget and allocation. 

Process: 
1. Data Understanding 
	- Number of variables (Categorical, discrete, continuous)
	- Visualization
2. Exploratory Data Anlysis
	- Descriptive Analysis of CustomerLifetimeValue.
	- LTV by Geography.
	- Descriptive Analysis ofTotalClaimAmount 
3. Data Processing
	- Add latitude and longitude coordinates columns.
	- Create bins for LTV customers (5 bins).
	- Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
	- Use MinMaxScaler to scale the numerical data.
	- Separate the data into training and testing data.
4. Multiple Linear Regression
	- Determine Coefficient Weights
5. Neural Network Model
6. Dashboard

#### Summary visuals


* If time allows: We would also like to take into acount claims and estimate a cost for the company and deduct from LTV,
in order to have a more comprehensive metric.
